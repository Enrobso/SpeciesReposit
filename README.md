# SpeciesReposit
This program was a practise question from the textbook. In the interface, you can add a species, specify the name and the population. When finished, the file is saved to a .txt file. This file is overriden everytime the user saves a new species file.
When desired, the user can then run the filereader which runs the last saved file. The two species with the greatest and smallest populations are displayed.
